# Specification: Customer Deposit Wallet

## Synopsis

üöß DRAFT 2025-01-29

This document specifies the core functionality of a **customer deposit wallet**,
or **deposit wallet** for short.

A deposit wallet allows you to track the **origin of incoming funds**:
Each customer is assigned a unique address belonging to the wallet;
a deposit made at this address is treated as originating from the customer.

However, outgoing funds are not distinguished by customer
‚Äî once funds have gone into the wallet,
they are all part of a **single wallet balance**.

A deposit wallet is useful for businesses such
as centralized exchanges (CEX) or e-shops on Cardano.

Technically, each customer is represented by a numerical index starting at `0`.
The deposit wallet manages a mapping between indices and addresses,
and tracks incoming funds for each known address.

When spending funds from the deposit wallet,
the corresponding transaction includes change outputs
that return surplus funds to the wallet.
It is important that these **change outputs** do **not**
correspond to any **known customer addresses**
‚Äî otherwise they would be treated as originating from a customer!
Unfortunately, this property is not guaranteed for other wallet software,
such as [cardano-wallet][] ‚Äî and this led to a very expensive bug,
where customers were credited with funds that they had never deposited.
The main motivation for this specification is to
explicitly state that this property should hold,
to formulate it with precision,
and to do so in a way that is amenable to compiler-checked proof.

# Setup

This document is a [literate Agda][lagda] file: It contains prose that
describes and explains the specification, but it also contains definitions
and logical properties that can be checked by the proof assistant [Agda][].

When implementing this specification,
we intend to create a **machine-checked proof**
that our implementation matches this specification.
However, this specification only covers the **core functionality** of
the software application to be implemented, not the full software.
We proceed as follows:

* The full software application will be implemented in [Haskell][].
  Sizeable parts of the functionality will be tested, not proven.

* However, the core functionality that is covered by this specification
  will be implemented using [Agda][] and exported to Haskell
  via the [agda2hs][] transpiler.
  This core functionality will be proven, not tested.

* In turn, proofs about the core functionality will depend on the
  assumption that more basic data types provided by Haskell libraries,
  such as the [Data.Set][containers] type,
  have implementations that match a specification.
  For the time being, we accept that this is an assumption
  and that the library implementations have only been tested.
  We `postulate` specifications in Agda as far as needed.

## Imports

In order to formulate the specification, we need to import standard Haskell vocabulary

```agda
open import Haskell.Prelude
open import Haskell.Reasoning
```

and also

* [Specification.Common](Specification/Common.lagda.md)
  ‚Äî Minor additional Haskell concepts.

In addition, we also need to import concepts that are specific to Cardano:

* [Specification.Cardano](Specification/Cardano.lagda.md)
  * [Specification.Cardano.Chain](Specification/Cardano/Chain.lagda.md)
  ‚Äî Type `Slot`.
  * [Specification.Cardano.Tx](Specification/Cardano/Tx.lagda.md)
  ‚Äî Transaction type `Tx`.
  * [Specification.Cardano.Value](Specification/Cardano/Value.lagda.md)
  ‚Äî Monetary `Value`. Includes both native coins (ADA) and
user-defined assets, such as stablecoins or NFTs.

# Specification

## Overview

This specification of a **customer deposit wallet**
amounts to the specification of an abstract data type `WalletState`,
which represents the entire state of such a wallet.

The goal of this document is to specify the operations
on this abstract data type and the logical properties that relate them.

We define a `module` `DepositWallet` which is parametrized by

* the abstract data type `WalletState` that we wish to specify,
* a specification `SigCardano` of Cardano-related concepts
that we need to formulate this specification, and
* a specification `SigWallet` of wallet-related concepts that are
  not the focus of this document.

```agda
module
  DepositWallet
    (WalletState : Set)
    (XPub : Set)
    (SigCardano : Specification.Cardano.Signature)
    (SigWallet  : Specification.Wallet.UTxO.Signature SigCardano)
  where

  open Specification.Cardano.Signature SigCardano
  open Specification.Wallet.UTxO.Signature SigWallet
```

## Operations

We now list all auxiliary data types and all
operations supported by the abstract data type `WalletState`.
This list is meant for reference
‚Äî we will explain each of them in detail in the subsequent sections.

Auxiliary data types:

```agda
  Customer = Word31

  record ValueTransfer : Set where
    field
      spent    : Value
      received : Value

  open ValueTransfer

  TxSummary : Set
  TxSummary = Slot √ó TxId √ó ValueTransfer
```

Operations:

```agda
  record Operations : Set where
    field

      deriveCustomerAddress : XPub ‚Üí Customer ‚Üí Address
      fromXPubAndMax        : XPub ‚Üí Word31 ‚Üí WalletState
      listCustomers         : WalletState ‚Üí List (Customer √ó Address)

      totalUTxO     : WalletState ‚Üí UTxO
      getWalletSlot : WalletState ‚Üí Slot
      applyTx       : Slot ‚Üí Tx ‚Üí WalletState ‚Üí WalletState
      isOurs        : WalletState ‚Üí Address ‚Üí Bool

      getCustomerHistory
        : WalletState ‚Üí Customer ‚Üí List TxSummary

      createPayment
        : List (Address √ó Value)
        ‚Üí PParams ‚Üí WalletState ‚Üí Maybe TxBody
```

## Properties

In subsequent sections, we will specify the properties that
the operations should satisfy.

The following record collects the properties:

```agda
  record Properties (O : Operations) : Set‚ÇÅ where
    open Operations O
```

### Mapping between Customers and Address

The defining feature of the deposit wallet
is that it keeps track of a mapping between customers and addresses.
We begin by specifying this mapping.

The type `Customer` denotes a unique identifier for a customer.
For reasons explained later, we choose to represent this type
as a numerical index:

    Customer = Word31

The mapping between customers and addresses is maintained by
the following operations:

    deriveCustomerAddress : XPub ‚Üí Customer ‚Üí Address

    fromXPubAndMax        : XPub ‚Üí Word31 ‚Üí WalletState
    listCustomers         : WalletState ‚Üí List (Customer √ó Address)

Here,

* `deriveCustomerAddress` deterministically creates an address
  for a given customer index.

* `fromXPubAndMax xpub cmax` creates an empty `WalletState`
  at genesis which keeps track of customers indices `0` to `cmax`.
  Their addresses are derived deterministically from the public key `xpub`.

* `listCustomers` returns the mapping between customers and addresses
  currently maintained by the `WalletState`.

In order to make the specification clear and simple,
we do not allow the mapping between customers and addresses
to change after creation
‚Äî the idea is that `listCustomers` will always return the same result,
no matter how the `WalletState` is changed subsequently.

The result of the function `listCustomers` contains
the entire mapping between customers and addresses.
The following definitions make this mapping easier to discuss:

```agda
    customerAddress : Customer ‚Üí WalletState ‚Üí Maybe Address
    customerAddress c = lookup c ‚àò listCustomers

    knownCustomer : Customer ‚Üí WalletState ‚Üí Bool
    knownCustomer c = isJust ‚àò customerAddress c

    knownCustomerAddress : Address ‚Üí WalletState ‚Üí Bool
    knownCustomerAddress a = elem a ‚àò map snd ‚àò listCustomers
```

We require that the mapping is a bijection

```agda
    unique : {{Eq a}} ‚Üí List a ‚Üí Bool
    unique xs = nub xs == xs

    isBijection : ‚àÄ {{_ : Eq a}} {{_ : Eq b}} ‚Üí List (a √ó b) ‚Üí Bool
    isBijection xys = unique (map fst xys) && unique (map snd xys)

    field
      prop-listCustomers-isBijection
        : ‚àÄ (w : WalletState)
        ‚Üí isBijection (listCustomers w) ‚â° True
```

The relation between `listCustomers` and `fromXPubAndMax`
is specified as follows:
First, the mapping precisely contains customers indices `0` to `cmax`:

```agda
      prop-listCustomers-fromXPubAndMax-max
        : ‚àÄ (c : Customer) (xpub : XPub) (cmax : Word31)
        ‚Üí knownCustomer c (fromXPubAndMax xpub cmax)
          ‚â° (0 <= c && c <= cmax)
```

Second, the addresses are derived deterministically from
the public key and the customer index.

```agda
      prop-listCustomers-fromXPubAndMax-xpub
        : ‚àÄ (c : Customer)
            (xpub : XPub)
            (cmax : Word31)
            (addr : Address)
        ‚Üí customerAddress c (fromXPubAndMax xpub cmax)
          ‚â° Just addr
        ‚Üí deriveCustomerAddress xpub c
          ‚â° addr
```

The idea is that these properties hold not only for the initial state
at `fromXPubAndMax`, but also for any state obtained through
other operations such as `applyTx`.

For compatibility with hardware wallets and the [BIP-32][] standard,
we derive the `Address` of each customer from the root private key
of the wallet in a deterministic fashion.
Specifically, using the notation of [BIP-32][] in pseudo-code,
we require that

  	deriveCustomerAddress : WalletState ‚Üí Word31 ‚Üí Address
	  deriveCustomerAddress s ix = rootXPrv s / 1857' / 1815' / 0' / 0 / ix

Here, `1857` is a new ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù identifier; we cannot reuse the [CIP-1852][] standard, because it behaves differently when discovering funds in blocks.

  [bip-32]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki
  [cip-1852]: https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip1852/

This method of deriving addresses is also the reason why we choose
a concrete representation of `Customer` as `Word31`.

### Transactions and slots

Transactions are used to spend from or send funds to a wallet.
The type `Tx` represents a transaction.
The `WalletState` may keep a history of transactions.
In order to keep a history, we need a notion of time
‚Äî we use the type `Slot` to keep track of time,
as this type represents a time interval in which
one block can be forged.

In order to apply a `Tx` to the `WalletState`,
we specify a function

    applyTx : Slot ‚Üí Tx ‚Üí WalletState ‚Üí WalletState

The first argument of this function is the `Slot`
of the block in which the transaction was included.

Transactions have to be applied in increasing `Slot` order.
For this reason, we also specify a function

    getWalletSlot : WalletState ‚Üí Slot

that records the last `Slot` for which a transaction was
applied; this property is express as:

```agda
      prop-getWalletSlot-applyTx
        : ‚àÄ (w    : WalletState)
            (slot : Slot)
            (tx   : Tx)
        ‚Üí (getWalletSlot w <= slot) ‚â° True
        ‚Üí getWalletSlot (applyTx slot tx w)
          ‚â° slot
```

An initial `WalletState` created with `fromXPubAndMax`
starts at genesis:

```agda
      prop-getWalletSlot-fromXPubAndMax
        : ‚àÄ (xpub : XPub)
            (cmax : Customer)
        ‚Üí getWalletSlot (fromXPubAndMax xpub cmax)
          ‚â° genesis
```

For completeness, we decree that `applyTx` with a past `Slot`
are a no-op on the `WalletState`:

```agda
      prop-getWalletSlot-applyTx-past
        : ‚àÄ (w    : WalletState)
            (slot : Slot)
            (tx   : Tx)
        ‚Üí (getWalletSlot w <= slot) ‚â° False
        ‚Üí applyTx slot tx w
          ‚â° w
```

Finally, we specify that the mapping between customers
and addresses is unchanged by transactions:

```agda
      prop-listCustomers-applyTx
        : ‚àÄ (w    : WalletState)
            (slot : Slot)
            (tx   : Tx)
        ‚Üí listCustomers (applyTx slot tx w)
          ‚â° listCustomers w
```

### Wallet balance and transactions

The primary purpose of a wallet is to keep track of funds
that are available for spending.

On the Cardano blockchain,
this means keeping track of unspent transaction outputs (UTxO).
This topic is discussed in more detail in

* [Specification.Wallet.UTxO](Specification/Wallet/UTxO.lagda.md)

Here, we only introduce basic concepts of UTxO management,
as we want to focus on the relation between customer addresses
and funds in the wallet.

The basics of `UTxO` management are as follows:
The total UTxO of the wallet that can be spent is given by the function

    totalUTxO : WalletState ‚Üí UTxO

A transaction of type `Tx` may spend some outputs
and create new ones.
We assume that a function

    applyTxToUTxO : (Address ‚Üí Bool) ‚Üí Tx ‚Üí UTxO ‚Üí UTxO

applies the transaction to the `UTxO`.
Here, the first argument is a predicate that specifies which output
addresses of a transactions belong to the wallet.
For the Deposit Wallet,
the addresses belonging to the wallet are given by a function

    isOurs : WalletState ‚Üí Address ‚Üí Bool

Now, we extend the discussion to the entire `WalletState`:
First, we consider the predicate `isOurs`.
We require that all known customer addresses belong to the wallet

```agda
      prop-knownCustomerAddress-isOurs
        : ‚àÄ (addr : Address)
            (w    : WalletState)
        ‚Üí knownCustomerAddress addr w ‚â° True
        ‚Üí isOurs w addr ‚â° True
```

However, there may be additional addresses belonging to the wallet,
in particular change addresses.

Second, we consider the application of a transaction.
We require that `applyTx`
is equivalent to `applyTxToUTxO` on the `totalUTxO`:

```agda
      prop-totalUTxO-applyTx
        : ‚àÄ (slot : Slot)
            (w    : WalletState)
            (tx   : Tx)
        ‚Üí (getWalletSlot w <= slot) ‚â° True
        ‚Üí totalUTxO (applyTx slot tx w)
          ‚â° applyTxToUTxO (isOurs w) tx (totalUTxO w)
```

### Tracking incoming funds

The wallet tracks all addresses in `listCustomers`
whenever new blocks are incorporated into the wallet state.

The result of tracking is given by the operation

    getCustomerHistory : WalletState ‚Üí Customer ‚Üí List TxSummary

For a given customer,
this operation returns a list of transaction summaries.
A transaction summary (`TxSummary`)
reports the total `Value` spent or received
by the customer within a specific transaction.
The summary also includes the transaction id (`TxId`)
and the `Slot` at which the transaction was included in the blockchain.

    record ValueTransfer : Set where
      field
        spent    : Value
        received : Value

    open ValueTransfer

    TxSummary : Set
    TxSummary = Slot √ó TxId √ó ValueTransfer

Note that the deposit wallet does not support
delegation and reward accounts
‚Äî the `spent` field only records value spent from transaction
outputs.

The main purpose of the function `getCustomerHistory` is to
track the origin of incoming funds.
When a transactions makes a payment to an `address`
that belongs to a known customer `c`,
`customerAddress c ‚â° Just address`,
a transaction summary with the corresponding transaction id
will show up in the result of `getCustomerHistory`
for the customer `c`.
This summary will record the total value that this customer
`received` in this transaction.

Note that the `spent` field in the `TxSummary` is for information only
‚Äî the deposit wallet does not distinguish customers when spending,
funds are taken out from customer addresses at random.
See the discussion of `createPayment` in a later section.

In order to specify the behavior of `getCustomerHistory`
more precisely,
we assume two functions

    spentTx    : Address ‚Üí Tx ‚Üí UTxO ‚Üí Value
    receivedTx : Address ‚Üí Tx ‚Üí Value

which total the value spend, respectively received,
at a given address when a transaction is applied to a `UTxO`.
These functions are from
[Specification.Wallet.UTxO](./Specification/Wallet/UTxO.lagda.md).
We group them in a function

```agda
    summarizeTx : Address ‚Üí Tx ‚Üí UTxO ‚Üí ValueTransfer
    summarizeTx addr tx u = record
      { spent    = spentTx addr tx u
      ; received = receivedTx addr tx
      }
```

Now, we require that applying a transaction to the
wallet state will add the summary of this transaction to
`getCustomerHistory`:

```agda
    field
      prop-getCustomerHistory-applyTx
        : ‚àÄ (w : WalletState)
            (c : Customer)
            (address : Address)
            (tx : Tx)
            (slot : Slot)
        ‚Üí (c , address) ‚àà listCustomers w
        ‚Üí (getWalletSlot w <= slot) ‚â° True
        ‚Üí getCustomerHistory (applyTx slot tx w) c
          ‚â° (slot , getTxId tx , summarizeTx address tx (totalUTxO w))
            ‚à∑ getCustomerHistory w c
```

On the other hand,
customers that are not known will not be tracked:

```agda
      prop-getCustomerHistory-knownCustomer
        : ‚àÄ (w : WalletState)
            (c : Customer)
        ‚Üí knownCustomer c w ‚â° False
        ‚Üí getCustomerHistory w c
          ‚â° []
```

Finally, a wallet that was just initialized does
not contain a history of transactions, yet:

```agda
      prop-getCustomerHistory-fromXPubAndMax
        : ‚àÄ (xpub : XPub) (cmax : Customer) (c : Customer)
        ‚Üí getCustomerHistory (fromXPubAndMax xpub cmax) c
          ‚â° []
```

The above properties provide a specification of
tracking incoming funds via `getCustomerHistory`.
For larger transaction histories,
this function may not offer the best performance
‚Äî for example, it does not limit the list of transactions,
and we cannot query recent transactions by customers.
However, we only specify one function here,
because these other queries can be specified
in terms of the result of `getCustomerHistory` alone,
without further reference to the `WalletState`.

### Creating transactions

The main purpose of a wallet is to keep track of funds available
for spending ‚Äî and to provide a method for spending them when desired.
For the latter task, we specify an operation

    createPayment
      : List (Address √ó Value)
      ‚Üí PParams ‚Üí WalletState ‚Üí Maybe TxBody

which maybe constructs a transaction that sends given `Value`s
to given destination `Address`es.
Here, `PParams` are protocol parameters such as maximum transaction size
or fee size that are needed to construct a valid transaction.

We want this function to satisfy multiple requirements:

1. The creation of a transaction **succeeds** if
   the wallet has **sufficients funds**
   to cover the payments and a small amount of fees.
2. The transaction will be **accepted** by the Cardano **ledger**.
3. The transaction **reflects** the **intention**,
   i.e. only the desired payments are made,
   and all other transaction outputs belong to the wallet.

For the deposit wallet,
we additionally require that the transaction
does not interfere with the tracking of addresses and customers.
Specifically,

4. The transaction does **not send funds** to a **known customer**
   unless that customer is specifically mentioned
   as payment destination.

This can be seen as a strengthening of the third property,
where the other transaction outputs are additionally required
to not be known customer addresses.

However, there are also requirements that we do not impose.
Specifically, we do **not require** that `createPayment`
picks any particular **transaction inputs**
‚Äî all funds within the wallet are treated as interchangeable,
and can be spent as desired.
In other words, we do not distinguish funds in the wallet by customer anymore
‚Äî we only track the customer when funds move into the wallet.
This is in contrast to alternative wallet styles that track a per-customer balance.

Formalizing these requirements is laborious.
The first requirement is difficult to implement,
we defer its discussion to
[Specification.Wallet.Payment](Specification/Wallet/Payment.lagda.md)
TODO: Call this balance.
The second requirement would need a more detailed
formalization of the Cardano ledger UTXO and UTXOW rules,
which is out of scope here.

Fortunately, not meeting the first two requirements
only makes the software less useable,
as this would only mean that we cannot create
some desired transactions
‚Äî but we never create transactions that go against our intentions.
Hence, we only formalize the third and fourth requirement here.

We formalize the third requirement in two properties:

* Each payment destination has to appear at least once
  in the transaction outputs.
* Conversely, each transaction output has to be
  a payment output or has to belong to the wallet.

We formalize the first property as follows:
Assuming that `createPayment` applied to the payment `destinations`
succeeds, we require that the `destinations` are a subsequence
of the transactions outputs:

```agda
    field
      prop-createPayment-destinations
        : ‚àÄ (w  : WalletState)
            (pp : PParams)
            (destinations : List (Address √ó Value))
            (tx : TxBody)
          ‚Üí createPayment destinations pp w ‚â° Just tx
          ‚Üí isSubsequenceOf destinations (outputs tx)
            ‚â° True
```

Above, we have to be mindful of
the possibility that payments destinations can be duplicated,
that is why we use `isSubsequenceOf` to make sure that
every one of them is included.
Strictly speaking, this is unnecessarily restrictive
on the order of the transaction outputs,
but the order can always be arranged.

We formalize the converse property as follows:

```agda
      prop-createPayment-isOurs
        : ‚àÄ (w  : WalletState)
            (pp : PParams)
            (destinations : List (Address √ó Value))
            (tx : TxBody)
          ‚Üí createPayment destinations pp w ‚â° Just tx
          ‚Üí all (isOurs w ‚àò fst) (outputs tx \\ destinations)
            ‚â° True
```

This property above states that if `createPayment destinations`
succeeds in creating a transaction `tx`,
then after removing the `destinations` from the transaction outputs
(using the operation `(\\)` from `Data.List`),
all output addresses belong to the wallet.
Again, we have to be mindful of the possibility that
the transaction outputs may contain duplicate `destinations`;
using the `(\\)` operation is the most systematic way
to handle that possibility.

Finally, we formalize the fourth requirement
that is specific to the deposit wallet:

```agda
      prop-createPayment-not-known
        : ‚àÄ (pp : PParams)
            (w  : WalletState)
            (destinations : List (Address √ó Value))
            (tx : TxBody)
        ‚Üí createPayment destinations pp w ‚â° Just tx
        ‚Üí ‚àÄ (address : Address)
          ‚Üí knownCustomerAddress address w ‚â° True
          ‚Üí ¬¨ (address ‚àà map fst destinations)
          ‚Üí ¬¨ (address ‚àà map fst (outputs tx))
```

This property above states that if `createPayment destinations`
succeeds in creating a transaction `tx`,
then for all `address`es,
if that address belongs to a known customer,
but does not appear in the `destinations`,
then it shall not appear in the transaction outputs either.
