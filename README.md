## Overview

This repository contains wallet implementations for the Cardano blockchain that are formally verified to some degree. The implementations are [Haskell][] packages, but generated using [agda2hs][], with proofs in [Agda][].

  [agda2hs]: https://github.com/agda/agda2hs
  [haskell]: https://haskell.org

## Contents

This repository is strucured as follows:

* `flake.nix` ‚Äî Nix flake for a development shell with relevant Haskell and Agda tools in scope.
* `lib/`
    * `customer-deposit-wallet-pure/` ‚Äî Specification and implementation of a pure Deposit Wallet.
    * `cardano-wallet-read/` ‚Äî Data types that correspond to the Cardano Ledger specification, implemented via the [cardano-ledger][] packages.

Each of the packages in the `lib/` directory may contain the following subdirectories:

* `agda/` ‚Äî Haskell-in-Agda code with some proofs.
* `haskell/` ‚Äî Haskell code that corresponds to the code in `agda/`. Most source code files are autogenerated from the `agda/` directory using `agda2hs`, but not all. This code is checked into the repository, so that downstream projects do *not* need the Agda compiler.

## QuickStart

Prerequisites:

* [Nix package manager][nix].

How to build:

```console
nix develop
just haskell
just build
```

How to run tests:

* There are no unit tests for `customer-deposit-wallet-pure` ‚Äî only compiler-checked proofs. üòè
* To run the unit tests for `cardano-wallet-read`, use `just test`.

How to run:

* N/A. This project is a [Haskell package][hackage]. For an exectuable wallet, see the [cardano-wallet][] project.

## Contributors

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Roadmap

* Completion of implementation.
* Completion of proofs.
